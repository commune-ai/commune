# Sidebar Implementation

The sidebar has been successfully implemented with the following features:

## Features
- **Toggle Button**: A hamburger menu icon in the top-left corner of the header
- **Slide Animation**: Smooth slide-in/slide-out animation when toggling
- **Overlay**: Dark overlay appears behind sidebar on mobile devices
- **Responsive**: Works on both desktop and mobile
- **Event-Driven**: Uses custom events to communicate between components

## Components Created

### 1. Header Component (`./app/components/Header.tsx`)
- Contains the hamburger menu button
- Manages sidebar toggle state
- Dispatches custom events to control sidebar

### 2. Sidebar Component (`./app/components/Sidebar.tsx`)
- Listens for toggle events
- Slides in from the left when opened
- Contains navigation links
- Has a close button

### 3. Layout (`./app/layout.tsx`)
- Imports and renders both Header and Sidebar components
- Provides the overall app structure

## Usage
Click the hamburger menu icon (â˜°) in the top-left corner to expand the sidebar. Click the X button or the overlay to close it.

## Styling
The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling with dark mode support.
