Testing on Commune 

Requirements
- pytest

Install pytest

```
pip install pytest
```

Here is the testing suite. Look at the modules that are being tested in the core repo, each has their own testing sweet or even a module that is suffixed with test.

For instance

```
c server.test/test is the same as c server/test
```

To test it 

```
pytest test
```
