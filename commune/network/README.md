The internet is a collection of servers where the name maps to the address. 

A namespace is a map of the server's name to the servers address
A network is an object that contains a namespace and it can generalize to any blockchain or web2 network.

Servers

A server is a module that can be accessed by a network. It is a collection of functions that can be called by the network. Each function is called by its method name like an rpc call


Network

A network is an object that contains a namespace and it can generalize to any blockchain or web2 network. The network is a collection of servers that can be accessed by the network. Each server is a collection of functions that can be called by the network. Each function is called by its method name like an rpc call

Register a server

To register a server to a network, the server must be added to the network's namespace. The server is added to the namespace by its name and the server's address. The server's address is the address of the server's module. The server's module is the module that contains the server's functions. The server's functions are the functions that can be called by the network. Each function is called by its method name like an rpc call


Deregister a server

To deregister a server from a network, the server must be removed from the network's namespace. The server is removed from the namespace by its name. The server's name is the name of the server's module. The server's module is the module that contains the server's functions. The server's functions are the functions that can be called by the network. Each function is called by its method name like an rpc call


Incentived Networks

Incentived networks are networks that reward users for using the network. The network rewards users by giving them tokens for using the network. The tokens are given to the users for using the network's services. The services are the functions that can be called by the network. Each function is called by its method name like an rpc call

Non-Incentived Networks

Non-incentived networks are networks that do not reward users for using the network. The network does not reward users for using the network. The network does not give tokens to the users for using the network's services. The services are the functions that can be called by the network. Each function is called by its method name like an rpc call

Flexible Networks

Flexible networks are networks that can be used for any purpose. The network can be used for any purpose. The network can be used for any blockchain or web2 network. The network can be used for any server or module. The network can be used for any function or method. The network can be used for any rpc call or service
