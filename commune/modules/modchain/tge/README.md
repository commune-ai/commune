# TGE (Token Generation Event) Documentation

## Overview

A Token Generation Event (TGE) is a pivotal moment in the lifecycle of a blockchain project where tokens are created and initially distributed to participants. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about TGEs, from fundamental concepts to advanced implementation strategies.

## What is a TGE?

A Token Generation Event represents the birth of a new cryptocurrency or digital token on a blockchain network. Unlike traditional Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), TGEs focus on the actual technical process of token creation and distribution, emphasizing utility and ecosystem development over pure fundraising.

### Key Components

1. **Smart Contract Deployment**: The foundational code that governs token behavior
2. **Token Minting**: The process of creating the initial token supply
3. **Distribution Mechanism**: How tokens are allocated to different stakeholders
4. **Vesting Schedules**: Time-based release of tokens to prevent market manipulation
5. **Governance Framework**: Rules for decision-making within the token ecosystem

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Structure

```solidity
// Example TGE Contract Structure
contract TGEContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    mapping(address => VestingSchedule) public vesting;
    
    struct VestingSchedule {
        uint256 totalAmount;
        uint256 startTime;
        uint256 cliffDuration;
        uint256 vestingDuration;
        uint256 releasedAmount;
    }
}
```

### Token Standards

- **ERC-20**: Standard fungible token interface for Ethereum
- **ERC-721**: Non-fungible token standard
- **BEP-20**: Binance Smart Chain token standard
- **SPL**: Solana Program Library token standard

## Distribution Models

### 1. Public Sale
- Open to general public
- Usually conducted through launchpads or DEXs
- Implements anti-bot measures and fair launch mechanisms

### 2. Private Sale
- Reserved for strategic investors and VCs
- Typically includes longer vesting periods
- Negotiated terms and pricing

### 3. Team Allocation
- Reserved for founders, developers, and advisors
- Subject to strict vesting schedules (typically 2-4 years)
- Cliff periods to ensure long-term commitment

### 4. Community Rewards
- Airdrops for early supporters
- Liquidity mining incentives
- Staking rewards
- Bug bounty programs

### 5. Treasury/Ecosystem Fund
- Reserved for future development
- Partnership incentives
- Marketing and growth initiatives

## Tokenomics Design

### Supply Mechanics

**Total Supply Calculation**:
```
Total Supply = Initial Supply + Inflation - Burn Mechanisms
```

### Distribution Example

| Allocation | Percentage | Vesting Period | Cliff |
|------------|------------|----------------|-------|
| Public Sale | 20% | Immediate | None |
| Private Sale | 15% | 18 months | 6 months |
| Team | 20% | 36 months | 12 months |
| Community Rewards | 25% | 48 months | None |
| Treasury | 20% | As needed | None |

### Economic Models

1. **Deflationary Model**: Token burns reduce supply over time
2. **Inflationary Model**: New tokens minted as rewards
3. **Dual-Token System**: Governance token + utility token
4. **Bonding Curves**: Dynamic pricing based on supply/demand

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Planning (Weeks 1-4)
- Define token utility and use cases
- Design tokenomics model
- Legal structure and compliance review
- Technical architecture planning

### Phase 2: Development (Weeks 5-12)
- Smart contract development
- Security audits (multiple firms recommended)
- Testing on testnet
- Frontend/backend infrastructure

### Phase 3: Pre-Launch (Weeks 13-16)
- Marketing campaign launch
- Community building
- Whitelist registration
- KYC/AML procedures

### Phase 4: TGE Execution (Day 0)
- Contract deployment to mainnet
- Token minting
- Distribution to wallets
- DEX liquidity provision
- CEX listings (if applicable)

### Phase 5: Post-TGE (Ongoing)
- Vesting schedule management
- Community engagement
- Product development
- Governance implementation

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security

1. **Multi-Signature Wallets**: Require multiple approvals for critical functions
2. **Time Locks**: Delay execution of sensitive operations
3. **Pausable Contracts**: Emergency stop functionality
4. **Upgrade Mechanisms**: Proxy patterns for bug fixes

### Audit Requirements

- Minimum 2 independent security audits
- Bug bounty program pre and post-launch
- Formal verification for critical components
- Continuous monitoring and incident response plan

### Common Vulnerabilities

- Reentrancy attacks
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Front-running vulnerabilities
- Flash loan attacks
- Governance attacks

## Regulatory Compliance

### Jurisdictional Considerations

1. **United States**: SEC regulations, Howey Test compliance
2. **European Union**: MiCA regulations
3. **Asia-Pacific**: Varied regulations by country
4. **Offshore**: Cayman Islands, BVI, Singapore structures

### KYC/AML Requirements

- Identity verification for participants
- Source of funds documentation
- Sanctions screening
- Transaction monitoring

### Tax Implications

- Token classification (utility vs security)
- Capital gains treatment
- VAT/GST considerations
- Cross-border tax treaties

## Marketing and Community

### Pre-TGE Marketing

1. **Content Strategy**
   - Whitepaper publication
   - Technical documentation
   - Educational content
   - Partnership announcements

2. **Community Channels**
   - Discord/Telegram groups
   - Twitter/X presence
   - Reddit communities
   - YouTube content

3. **Influencer Partnerships**
   - KOL engagement
