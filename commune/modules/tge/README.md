phase 1 (10/15/2025 -> 01/01/2026) (1 million tokens)


Initial Distribution (Claimable Airdrop)
- initial distirbution of holders will be 1 million tokens on mainnet launch 
- holders of comai will need to proove they hold tokens on either ethereum, solana or mainnet (please bridge off of mexc prior to october 15th)
- holders will need to manually confirm the creation of $MOD from their comai, which will disitrbute proportionally to 1 million, without any dilution for certain holders. 


Phase 2 (12/01/2025 -> 01/01/2026) Stake-Time (3.2 million tokens)

- For the rest of the 3.2 million, stake time will be in effect based on the initial 1 millon tokens
- each wallet holder will need to choose a time period to lock their tokens up to 2 years.
- the staketime multiplier curve provides you staketime tokens baed on the multiplier , 0x for no locking (opting out), 1x for 1 year, and 4x for 2 years. 
- The vesting curve will distirbuted linearly over the course of the lock period, providing people who stake longer 


Tokenized Vesting

Your vesting can be sold on the market and you can fractionalize your vesting into staketime tokens, we will provide an amm module that will be based on uniswap v4 for a modular uniswap and will allow people to pair modchain with staketime

phase 3 (proof of contribution) (12/01/2025 -> inf)

- any new tokens generated will be generated based on the nominal US dollars that will be used through the protocal through either the following options
    -  locking liquidity into the protocal 
    - using the modules that are verified by the telemetry through paying in usdc/usdt via solana or base

- the price of minting will be decided based on 1 usd, where 1 usd added to the protocal will mint 1 new modchain. 

- if the price of modchain falls bellow this peg, the price will mint at a 10 pecent surcharge, forcing people to buy from the dexes or use the protocal to aquire newly minted tokens
- if the price is above 1 dollar, the chain will mint at a 10 percent discount
- the max amount of tokens that can be minted a day will follow the bitcoin inflation curve (scaled with 42 million), meaning that the protocal will only sell at most 14,400 tokens a day (2x7200), and will follow the inflation curve of bitcoin.
