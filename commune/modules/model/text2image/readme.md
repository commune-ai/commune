# Convert Text to Image Module - README

This module is designed for converting user prompt to call. It offers a `call` function that users can convert the text with customized parameters.
Here is the detailed explanation of the `call` function. Also I added docstring so that you can easily commit.

## Here's a detailed explanation of parameters for convert:

-`prompt`:        Prompt to generate image.
-`save_path`:     Path to the folder to save the results.


### Usage Example:

`c model.text2image call prompt="a cat sitting on the chair" save_path="cat"`
