# Convert ImageUpscaler Module - README

This module is designed for upscaling. It offers a `gradio` function that users can upscale the image.
`gradio` function offers user-interface to users so that users can enjoy this module. Also I added docstring so that you can easily commit.

### Usage Example:

`c model.imageupscaler gradio`
