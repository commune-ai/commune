Alright — here’s a structured draft of your new **white paper** for an “Any-to-Any Asset Loan System” based on your description. I’ve formalized concepts like vaults, vesting schedules, and cross-chain streaming in an L1 environment that stores addresses as arbitrary-length byte vectors.

# **Any-to-Any Asset Loan System: Vault-Based Cross-Chain Streaming Loans**

## **Abstract**

We present a decentralized lending framework enabling **any-to-any asset loans** between borrowers and lenders without intermediaries. The system forms a **mutual contract** when both parties agree on terms, including accepted collateral assets, the loan asset, and a **vesting schedule** that defines token emission back to the lender or borrower. All agreements are instantiated as **vaults**, which act as programmable asset controllers capable of streaming any token on any supported chain to any address. Vaults store cross-chain public keys as **arbitrary-length byte vectors** at the L1 level, enabling universal compatibility with heterogeneous key types.

---

## **1. Introduction**

Traditional lending platforms restrict supported assets and chains, requiring centralized orchestration. Our protocol enables:

* **Lender-defined loan offers** specifying the asset lent, accepted collateral, and repayment emission schedule.
* **Borrower-defined requests** specifying needed asset, offered collateral, and return stream.
* Automatic contract formation upon mutual agreement.
* Cross-chain delivery and repayment through **vault-based streaming**.

---

## **2. System Overview**

The system operates on three key primitives:

### **2.1 Vaults**

A **Vault** is an on-chain object defined as:

* **Owner Key:** A primary controlling key (vector of bytes) that can manage vault permissions.
* **Key Set:** A vault can own multiple sub-keys, each authorized to execute streaming schedules or manage specific assets.
* **Streaming Engine:** The vault can emit tokens over a time-based schedule (“tokens per day”) to any target address (vector of bytes) on any supported chain.

Formally:

$$
\text{Vault} := (\text{owner\_key}, \{\text{sub\_keys}\}, \{\text{streams}\})
$$

Where each stream is:

$$
\text{Stream} := (\text{token\_id}, \text{amount\_per\_day}, \text{destination\_chain}, \text{destination\_address\_vec}, \text{start\_time}, \text{end\_time})
$$

---

### **2.2 Loan Contracts**

A loan contract forms when:

1. A lender advertises:

   * Loan asset and amount.
   * Accepted collateral asset(s) and amount(s).
   * Vesting schedule for collateral release.
   * Vesting schedule for loan repayment.

2. A borrower advertises:

   * Desired asset and amount.
   * Collateral offered.
   * Vesting schedule for loan repayment.

**Mutual agreement** locks collateral in vaults and schedules repayment streams.

---

### **2.3 Vesting Schedules**

Each schedule defines the **emission profile** of a repayment or collateral release.
Example: Borrower repays 1,000 USDC over 100 days → stream emits 10 USDC/day to lender’s vault.

Schedules can be:

* **Linear:** Constant emission rate.
* **Cliff + Linear:** No emission until a start date, then linear release.
* **Custom Curve:** Arbitrary daily distribution vector.

---

## **3. Cross-Chain Address Model**

The L1 stores all addresses as **byte vectors**:

$$
\text{address\_vec} \in \{0,1\}^\*
$$

This supports:

* EVM 20-byte addresses.
* Solana 32-byte ed25519 public keys.
* Bitcoin compressed secp256k1 keys.
* Future key types without re-deploying contracts.

---

## **4. Protocol Flow**

1. **Offer Creation:** Lender or borrower publishes terms.
2. **Discovery:** Counterparties discover compatible offers.
3. **Mutual Agreement:** On-chain vault contract locks assets.
4. **Stream Initiation:** Vault streams start according to vesting schedules.
5. **Monitoring:** On-chain and off-chain services monitor stream adherence.
6. **Finalization:** At schedule completion, vault closes loan.

---

## **5. Vault Streaming Logic**

**Core Function:**

```pseudo
function create_stream(token, amount_per_day, dest_chain, dest_addr_vec, start_time, end_time):
    require(vault_balance[token] >= (amount_per_day * days))
    stream_id = hash(params)
    vault_streams[stream_id] = params
```

**Cross-Chain Execution:**

* Off-chain relayers or zk-bridges read vault events.
* Execute transfer on destination chain to `dest_addr_vec`.

---

## **6. Security Model**

* **Escrow Enforcement:** All assets locked in vault before stream begins.
* **Stream Cancellation Rules:** Can be mutually agreed upon; default is irrevocable once started.
* **Cross-Chain Proofs:** Optional zk-proofs or optimistic challenges ensure emitted tokens match schedule.

---

## **7. Economic Model**

* **Interest Rate:** Implied by repayment vs. loan principal.
* **Collateralization Ratio:** Configurable per contract.
* **Liquidation:** If repayment stream halts, vault can liquidate collateral streams to lender.

---

## **8. Implementation Considerations**

* **Storage:** L1 stores vault metadata + streams. Off-chain services execute cross-chain payments.
* **Bridges:** Abstracted so vault logic is agnostic to bridging method.
* **Gas Efficiency:** Byte-vector addresses reduce need for format-specific parsing.

---

## **Conclusion**

We define a universal, vault-based lending system enabling any-to-any asset loans with programmable vesting and streaming, leveraging arbitrary-length vectorized addresses for maximal chain compatibility. This creates a foundation for a global, interoperable credit layer.

If you want, I can now **turn this into a full LaTeX whitepaper with formal definitions, protocol diagrams, and economic proofs** similar to the one I just did for Proof of Utility & Cost. That would make it presentation-ready for investors or developers.
