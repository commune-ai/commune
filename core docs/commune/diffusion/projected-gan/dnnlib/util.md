This piece of code is a collection of utility functions and classes that can be used in many different contexts. Here are explanations for some of the key components:

- The `Logger` class: This class is used to direct the output of print statements and error messages. It can be configured to write all of the printed output to a text file, rather than the console. The file can be opened in write ("w") or append ("a") mode. The class also ensures the buffer, where text is temporarily stored, gets flushed after every write operation.

- `EasyDict` class: This is a convenience class that allows you to access dictionary values as attributes (with dot notation).

- `format_time` and `format_time_brief` functions: Converts time in seconds to a human-readable format, in the case of `format_time`: days, hours, minutes, and seconds, and in the case of `format_time_brief`: hours and minutes.

- `get_module_from_obj_name`, `get_obj_from_module`, `get_obj_by_name`, `call_func_by_name`, `construct_class_by_name`, and `get_module_dir_by_obj_name` functions: These functions are a set of utilities for dynamic import and calling of Python modules, classes, and functions given their string names.

- `listing_dir_recursively_with_ignore` and `copy_files_and_create_dirs` functions: These functions provide functionalities to manipulate and navigate the file system directories and files.

- `open_url` function: Its task is to download files from a given URL and return them as binary-mode file objects.

- Several other helper functions and utilities. 

This script can be beneficial as a kind of "toolkit" for a variety of programming tasks. For example, you can use it to log your outputs into text files, to dynamically import Python modules, or to manipulate filesystem directories and files. 

It is essential to note that the script also handles URL operations and can fetch files from URLs or check whether a given string is a URL. 

It also has capabilities to cache files locally, which can be crucial for managing repeated downloads of the same large data file.
