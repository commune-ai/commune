# README

The given python script defines an `AsyncModule` class inheriting from commune's `c.Module`. This class is designed to automatically convert asynchronous methods in the class to synchronous ones. This can be particularly useful when you're working in environments that do not natively support `asyncio` or when you need to use the results of async calls as if they were synchronous.

Key components of the script:

- `sync_the_async`: This method iterates through the attributes of the class, looks for methods whose names start with 'async_', and replaces them with their synchronous versions using the defined `sync_wrapper` method.
- `sync_wrapper`: This method takes an asyncio function and returns a wrapper function that behaves synchronously. It achieves this by running the asyncio function using the `run_until_complete` method of an asyncio event loop.

Example usage:

```python
class AsyncClass(AsyncModule):
    async def async_old_method():
        return await some_other_async_method()
        
# Create an instance
instance = AsyncClass()

# Calling the async_old_method directly would still be asynchronous
# But thanks to the AsyncModule, we can call it as if it was synchronous
result = instance.old_method()
```

Environments where this script would be useful are those where you need to utilize libraries that use asyncio for IO-bound tasks but need to work in a synchronous way, such as general scripting, Flask, and many other areas where asyncio event loops are not natively run.

Please make sure to call `sync_the_async` method after defining your asynchronous methods for them to be wrapped into synchronous. Also, note that although very useful, running asynchronous function as synchronous might diminish the performance benefits asyncio generally provides by handling IO-bound tasks concurrently. Use the functionality thoughtfully considering your project's requirements.
