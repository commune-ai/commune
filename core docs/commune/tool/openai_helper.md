# Aave Tool

This tool allows you to interact with the Aave protocol on Ethereum.

## Description

This tool fetches data from the Aave protocol, processes it, and returns the result.

## Parameters

- `poolAddress`: The Ethereum address of the Aave pool.
  - Defaults to the address of Aave's main market.

- `userAddress`: The Ethereum address of the user for whom you want to fetch data.
  - Defaults to the Zero address. 

- `etherscanApiKey`: The API key for Etherscan, a block explorer and analytics platform for Ethereum.
  - Defaults to a placeholder value.

## Returns

- A dictionary object containing various pieces of data about the specified pool and user.

## Usage

```python
# Initialize the tool
aave_tool = AaveTool()

# Get data for the default pool and user
result = aave_tool.call()

# Print the result
print(result)
```

## Dependencies

- Commune Module: A pre-built Python module.
- Json: A standard Python library for working with JSON data.
- Web3: A Python library for interacting with Ethereum. If not installed, use pip to install it as `pip install web3`.
- requests: A Python library for making HTTP requests. If not installed, use pip to install it as `pip install requests`.

## Setup

This tool connects to Ethereum through an Infura node. An Infura URL is already included in the code, but if you want to change it, edit the following line:

```python
infura_url = 'https://[network].infura.io/v3/[project]'
```

Replace `[network]` with the Ethereum network you want to connect to (e.g., 'mainnet', 'ropsten', etc.), and replace `[project]` with your project ID.
