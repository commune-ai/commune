# ReadMe

This python script describes a complex model class in PyTorch. The script provides methods for model initialization, processing input through the model, saving and loading model state, setting a learning rate, specifying device to run the model computations on, and loading state dictionaries. Other features include quantizing models, dealing with multiple-layer models, and parameter management.

## Methods

1. `__init__(self, config, **kwargs)`: Constructor, initialises the model by setting the config.

2. `set_config(self, config)`: Set the model configuration.

3. `forward(self,  **kwargs) -> Union[Dict, torch.Tensor]`: Propagates the input through the model.

4. `set_device(self, device:str = None, resolve_device: bool = True)`: Define the device where the model will be running its computations.

5. `save(self,  tag:str = None,  trainable_only: bool = True, verbose: bool = False, keys = None)`: Save the model state, allowing to continue training at a later point or reuse it in another context.

6. `load(self, tag=None,  keys:List[str] = None, map_location: str = None, **kwargs)`: Loads the saved state of the model.

7. `set_lr(self, lr:float)`: Set the learning rate for the model's optimizer.

8. `quantize(self, model:str, dynamic_q_layer:set = {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)`: Quantizes the model.

9. `resolve_device(cls, device:str = None) -> str`: Returns the device that the model should run its computations.

10. `num_params(self, trainable:bool = True) -> int`: returns the total number of parameters, either trainable or total (depends on the flag).

11. `base_model(cls)` and `train_fleet(cls, *args, **kwargs)`: Returns the base model and allows for training a model fleet (multiple models trained jointly).

12. `get_trainable_params(self, model: nn.Module)`: Returns the number of trainable parameters in the given model.

## Usage

After importing the necessary libraries and this script, you can create an object of class 'Model' and call the functions as per the requirement like loading the model, saving the model, training etc.

## Additional Notes

Make sure to install necessary libraries such as PyTorch before running this script and also ensure that for training the model the required dataset is present and properly loaded.
