# Demo Module for Commune

This Python script generates a demo module for Commune, a general-purpose module-based system. The demo module uses the given GitHub URL to clone a repository, prints out the configuration settings, and performs a simple addition operation.

## Overview

The `Demo` class is a module for Commune and uses the methods `set_config()` and `cmd()` from the Commune library. With initial variables `a` set to 1 and `b` set to 2, the `set_config()` method allows to store these settings within the configuration.

The `call()` method, on execution, prints the saved configuration settings. It then performs an addition operation on two variables, `x` and `y`, which by default are set to 1 and 2 respectively. 

The `clone()` method runs a command line operation to clone a specified GitHub repository. 

## Requirements

- **Python**: The script is written in Python, and thus requires Python (version 3.6 or later is recommended) to be installed on your computer.
- **Commune**: As this plug-in relies on the Commune library, Commune must be installed and properly configured on your machine prior to running this.

## Usage

### 1. Instantiate Demo Module

You can create an instance of the `Demo` module and initialize it as follows:

```python
demo = Demo(a=1, b=2)
```

### 2. Usage of 'call' Method

You can subsequently call the `call()` method to print out the set configuration settings and provide values for `x` and `y` for addition operations:

```python
demo.call(x=3, y=4)
```

### 3. Usage of 'clone' Method

You can then use the `clone()` method to clone the specified repository:

```python
demo.clone()
```
