# ERC-1155 smart contract

This is an implementation of an ERC-1155 smart contract in Rust using the `ink!` language.

This smart contract template includes the key functionalities according to the ERC-1155 token standard, including but not limited to:

- Creation and minting of tokens
- Handling single and batch transfers of tokens
- Querying the balance of a specific token for an account
- Querying the balances for a set of tokens for a set of accounts
- Transferring ownership of tokens
- Checking if an account is approved to manage another account's tokens

API documentation for the individual functions and their parameters / return results are in the code using `rustdoc` comments.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Rust and the cargo package manager
- The `ink!` language and its prerequisites (see https://paritytech.github.io/ink/)

### Setup

- Add your desired logic to the contract's functions
- Interact with your smart contract using a frontend or scripts that interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
