# ERC2981 Contract

The `ERC2981` contract provides implementation for the NFT Royalty Standard, a standardized way to retrieve royalty payment information. The standard mandates precise ways of retrieving royalty information but does not enforce its payment.

This contract works with the OpenZeppelin's `IERC2981` interface, and the `ERC165` contract, which is used for adding introspection. 

## Features

- **Royalty Information**: Royalty information can be specified globally for all tokens via `_setDefaultRoyalty` method. It can also be specified individually for specific token id's via `_setTokenRoyalty` method. The latter has a higher priority over the other.

- **Transparent Interface Handling**: The contract makes use of `ERC165` to handle interface-ID-to-implementation mapping in a transparent way.

- **Royalty Calculation**: The contract provides a `royaltyInfo` function that calculates and returns the royalty amount for a given token id and sale price.

- **Custom Fee Denominator**: By overriding `_feeDenominator` method, custom fee denominator can be defined. It defaults to 10000. 

- **Interfaces**: This contract implements `IERC2981` NFT Royalty standard interface and `IERC165` interface introspection contract.

## Usage

The methods provided by this contract can be used directly if the contract is inherited, or they can be used indirectly via calls to their addresses, if a contract instance is deployed.

## Example

To use this contract, you can create a new contract and inherit from it:

```solidity
contract MyNFT is ERC2981 {
    constructor() ERC721("MyNFT", "MNFT"){
        _setDefaultRoyalty(msg.sender, 500); // Set 5% as a default royalty
    }

    function mint(address to, uint tokenId) public {
        _mint(to, tokenId);
    }

    function setRoyalty(address receiver, uint96 feeNumerator) public {
        _setTokenRoyalty(tokenId, receiver, feeNumerator);
    }
}
```
In the above example, an NFT contract is created with a default royalty of 5%. The mint function allows new tokens to be created, and the setRoyalty function allows the royalty of specific tokens to be set.

## Available Since

`ERC2981` contract was made available in OpenZeppelin contracts since version 4.5.0.

## Prerequisites

The user should have basic understanding of Ethereum, Solidity, and NFTs (ERC721 or ERC1155 tokens).
