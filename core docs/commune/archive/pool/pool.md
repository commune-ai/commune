# Python Code Readme

This Python code implements a thread pool using a Thread-safe queue and workers implemented as threads or processes. The thread pool allows you to perform a large number of tasks by utilizing a limited number of threads or processes - which are much cheaper than creating a new one each time a task has to be performed.

It's a pretty straightforward code where it first imports necessary modules. Two main classes are defined: Pool and Worker. You create an object of the Pool class and assign tasks to it. Workers are created and tasked with executing the jobs from the queue. Jobs can either be executed in threads or in separate processes, depending on the specified mode.

## Key methods and properties in the `Pool` Class includes:

- `__init__`: Takes a list of modules. Initialises a thread Pool object and the associated Queues and Workers.

- `set_fn`: This method is used to define the task function to be executed by the workers.

- `resolve_queue_name`: Ensures that the name of a queue is always a string.

- `add_queue`: This method is responsible for creating a new queue.

- `add_queues`: This is a helper function that loops over several names and creates queues for them.

- `resolve_worker_name`: This method ensures that all workers have a unique identifier.

- `add_workers`: This method is used to add workers to the pool and delegates tasks to them.

- `add_worker`: This method adds a single worker to the pool.

- `forward_requests`: This starts the worker thread, fetches the tasks from the respective queue and executes them.

- `test`: This is a test method where jobs are put and gotten from the pool.

- `default_fn`: This is the default work function that is done by the workers when no function is provided.

- `kill_loop` & `kill_workers`: These function to stop the loop of processing and kill all workers respectively.

- `put` & `get`: These methods allow the user to add and get jobs from the queue.

__Please note that__ this code makes use of threading, multiprocessing and asyncio and thus requires a solid understanding of asychronous programming in Python. It is designed to minimize the time spent waiting for I/O operations by allowing tasks to be performed concurrently in separate threads or multiple processes for increased efficiency. 

The code ends in a guard clause that tests the functionality of the pool when run as a script.
