# Readme for Code "Tokenizer"

This Python code provides a tokenizer for various transformer models. 

## Class Breakdown

### 1. Tokenizer
This class serves as a tokenizer for Transformer models. 

On instantiation, it first sets the configuration, then initializes the tokenizer for the Transformer model. The tokenizer is capable of processing text data into a format that can be used for model training or prediction. 

Apart from the initialization function, this class also contains several other useful functions for interacting with token data.

- `set_tokenizer`: This function initializes the tokenizer for the Transformer model. 
- `resolve_device`: This function resolves the device where the computations will be performed.
- `tokenize`: This function processes the input text into tokenized format.
- `detokenize`: This function converts the tokenized input back to readable text.
- `test`: This function tests the tokenizer by tokenizing and then detokenizing a string.
- `deploy`: This function prepares the tokenizer for deployment.

Defining shortcuts for different models allows the user to quickly switch between different transformer models.

## Usage

To use this code, first, create an instance of the Tokenizer class. This will automatically set up the tokenizer based on the given configuration. 

You can then use the `tokenize` function to process your text into tokenized format that can be used for model training or prediction. 

If you need to turn your tokenized input back into human-readable text, you can use the `detokenize` function.

The `resolve_device` function provides an easy way to determine which device (CPU/GPU) will be used for computations, which can be useful in scenarios involving large datasets or complex models.

Finally, this class also contains a `test` function that tokenizes and then detokenizes a string, returning the output. This is useful for ensuring that the tokenizer is working as expected.

Finally, the `deploy` function prepares the tokenizer for deployment.

## Requirements

This code requires Python 3 along with the `transformers` and `commune` libraries.

Additional packages like `torch` and `streamlit` are required for working with PyTorch tensors and creating interactive web apps respectively. The 'commune' module is not a part of the standard Python library, so you might need to install it manually. Also, ensure that your Python version supports the necessary libraries.
