# Python Code Readme

The given Python script is based on the `ray` and `commune` libraries to establish a parallel preparation actor-system. In this script, there is a creation of `RayRedisServer` which extends from `Module` in the commune library. 

The main class is `RayRedisServer`, which connects with the Ray Redis Server over the Redis client and handles key-value store operations, specifically `set` and `get`.

Main features of the `RayRedisServer` are:

`set(key, message)`: This method is static and accepts a `key` and a `message` as parameters. This is used to store the `message` using the `key` on Ray's Redis server.

`get(key)`: This method is static and accepts a `key` as a parameter. It retrieves the value associated with the `key` from Ray's Redis server.

`create_actor()`: Class method which is used to create an actor instance of the `RayRedisServer` class. It has multiple parameters, including `actor_kwargs`, `actor_name`, `detached`, `resources`, `max_concurrency`, `refresh`, `return_actor_handle`, and `verbose`. This method utilizes a helper function `create_actor` from `commune.block.ray.utils` to create the actor.

Bear in mind that basic understanding of Ray and Redis is needed to fully operate and utilize this Python script. Here, Ray is applied as an open-source library that provides both task-parallelism and actor-model for simple construction and usage of distributed and parallel systems. And concurrently, Redis is a well-known in-memory database that backs the data in memory for fast read and write operations.

To run the script, you will first need to install `ray` and `commune` Python libraries. You can install them via pip with `pip install ray` and `pip install commune` commands. After you've installed these libraries, you can run the script using `python script_name.py` in the terminal/command prompt.
