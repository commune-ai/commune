# README

The code given defines a `Chat` class using the `commune` and `streamlit` libraries in Python. The `Chat` class uses features provided by both libraries to allow a user to interact with a conversational bot.

The `Chat` class means it is effectively an instance of a chat framework that consists of the following features:

- `chat`: This method takes in a text input and calls a specified function from a defined module for text generation. These text outputs are generated in a defined Commune network, be it local, remote or subspace network.

- `check_history`: This method checks the validity of the chat history. 

- `tool_selector`: This method selects the streamlit column variables and takes in user inputs about module, function, salt and key from the streamlit sidebar.

- `dashboard`: This is the main class method which uses the communal module and network to setup the dashboard with chat history and user inputs on the sidebar. 

This module provides a chat interface that can be either run as a standalone application or can be embedded into another application. In the case of running standalone, the chosen function is used to generate responses to user inputs and chat with the user.

An instance of this `Chat` class can be created and used like:

```python
chat = Chat()
chat_instance = chat.dashboard(server='model', key='key', network='network', fn='function')
```

Please ensure that you have the required packages, `commune` and `streamlit`, installed in your Python environment to run this code successfully.

Please note that this code was written with an interactive environment in mind (like Jupyter notebook) because of the use of `streamlit`. Accordingly, if you intend to run it in a script, keep note that it might not give optimal results due to the interactive nature of the model.
