# Selenium Module

This module, as part of the `commune` library, provides a way to use Selenium Web Driver in your Python code. 

## Overview

The main class `Selenium(c.Module)` is created which uses the `commune` library's `Module` as a base class. The class provides methods for setting up configuration, executing commands, managing Selenium Web Driver, and testing functionality.

## Setting Configurations

In the `__init__` function, `self.set_config(kwargs=locals())` helps you automatically take all function parameters and save them as a configuration. You can access it anytime with `self.config`.

## Function Calls

The `call` function simply adds two input integer values and returns their sum. It can be customized according to need.

## Module Installation

The `install` function allows the Selenium package to be installed via pip3.

## Browser Automation using Web Driver 

The `test` function is an example of how to use the Selenium WebDriver for browser automation. It automates the process of going to Google, searching for a keyword, and then processing the results.

Please note, the `test` function will not work without proper setup and configuration of Chrome WebDriver on your system.

## Note

Make sure to install the commune library (`pip install commune`) and Selenium WebDriver before running this module.

To run the functions as part of the commune API, you will also need to run a commune server. The Selenium module can then be included as part of the API functions, or used individually within your Python code.

Always remember, the Module class is intended to be overridden with actual tasks in real-life usage. This is just a placeholder and base setup.
