# README

This Python code defines an `Auth` class for user authentication in Streamlit applications. The class is a part of the `commune` module. This class integrates the streamlit-authenticator package and uses YAML configuration for managing the authentication details.

Key features of the `Auth` class include:

- Initial configuration: During initialization (`__init__`), the class loads a YAML configuration file, which contains details about the credentials, cookie configuration, and preauthorized users. A template for this configuration file is also provided.

- Password hashing: The `hash_passwords` method uses a `Hasher` from the `streamlit_authenticator` module to generate hash values for passwords, providing enhanced security and privacy.

- Authenticator creation: The `create_authenticator` function uses the `streamlit_authenticator`'s `Authenticate` class to instantiate an authenticator object, which is responsible for validating credentials and managing user sessions.

- User login and logout: The `login` and `logout` functions enable users to log in and out of the application.

- Handling authentication: The `handle_authentication` method integrates the authentication system into a Streamlit application interface, providing prompts and messages based on login attempts. This function can be extended to handle additional post-login operations.

- Installation: The `install` function installs the `streamlit-authenticator` package via pip. A message indicating successful installation is returned.

- Streamlit dashboard: The `dashboard` method creates a simple Streamlit dashboard for visualizing the authentication system. This method also provides an interface for users to log in and out.

To use this authentication module, instantiate the `Auth` class, call its methods in your Streamlit script, and remember to place your configurations in the specified YAML file.

Please note that this module requires the `commune`, `streamlit-authenticator`, and `streamlit` packages, which can be installed via pip.
