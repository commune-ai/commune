# Commune Python Package: An Ultimate Guide for Key Management

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on how to use the `commune` Python package for optimal management of keys, balances, stakes, and key statistics tailored to serve your particular needs. 

## Set Up the Environment

Start by importing the `commune` module with the given Python command:

```python
import commune as c
```

## Mastering Key Management

This section will walk you through the key-based functionalities of the commune module.

### Display All Keys

You can effortlessly obtain a list of all available keys by invoking the `keys()` function as follows:

```python
c.keys()
```

### Key Addition and Deletion

The `commune` package provides simple functions to add and delete keys.

**Add a new key:** Use the `add_key()` function and pass your preferred key name to it.

```python
c.add_key('myKey')
```

**Remove an existing key:** To delete a key, call the `rm_key()` function and replace 'demo' with the key you wish to remove.

```python
c.rm_key('myKey')
```

### Saving and Loading Keys

`Commune` module allows you to save your current keys for future use and load them when required.

**Save Keys:** To save your keys, use the `save_keys()` function.

```python
c.save_keys()
```

**Load Saved Keys:** To retrieve the saved keys, the `load_keys()` function comes to rescue.

```python
c.load_keys()
```

## Retrieve Key-related Statistics

The `commune` module includes functions to quickly fetch balance and stake information for a particular key, as well as key statistics.

### Check Key Balance 

To retrieve the balance related to a certain key, use the `get_balance()` function and replace 'myKey' with your targeted key.

```python
c.get_balance('myKey')
```

### Check Key Stake 

To determine the stake of a specific key, invoke the `get_stake()` function and replace 'myKey' with your chosen key.

```python
c.get_stake('myKey')
```

### Fetch Key Statistics

The module also provides an option to fetch key statistics for each subnet associated with a certain key. 

```python
c.key_stats('myKey')
```

## Wrapping Up 

This tutorial provided a step-by-step guide on managing keys, tracking balances, stakes, and key statistics using the `commune` Python package. Utilize it to create a system that fits your desired use case flawlessly.
