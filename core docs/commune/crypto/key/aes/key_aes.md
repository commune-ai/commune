# AESKey Module with Commune Library

This script is an advanced application of the Commune's `Module` to build a class `AESKey` for AES encryption and decryption. 

## Importing the Libraries
This script starts by importing the necessary libraries. 

```python
import base64
import hashlib
from Crypto import Random
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from copy import deepcopy
import json
import sys
import inspect
import time
import commune as c
```

## AESKey Class
The `AESKey` class is initialized with a key which is hashed to create a 32-byte key phrase for AES encryption. It uses AES-256 CBC mode and PKCS5 padding for encryption and decryption.

### Encrypting Data
The `encrypt` method uses the key phrase to AES encrypt the data and wraps it into a base64 string. The original data object is converted to a string format before encryption. 

### Decrypting Data
The `decrypt` method extracts the IV and the ciphertext from the base64 string and uses the IV and the key phrase to decrypt the ciphertext back to the original string format. The string is then converted back to the original data object.

### Padding and Unpadding
The `_pad` and `_unpad` methods aid in creating the required block size for AES encryption and getting back the original data from padded data, respectively.

### Testing
The `test_encrypt_decrypt` and `test_encrypt_decrypt_throughput` methods test the encryption and decryption processes for correctness and throughput respectively.

## Main Tests
The final `test` class method finds all other class methods that start with "test_" and runs them. This is useful for verifying the class behavior after modifications.

## Commune Library Dependency

Ensure that the Python environment has the Commune library. It can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install commune
```

## Crypto Library Dependency

Ensure that the Python environment has the Crypto library. It can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install pycrypto
```

This script provides a robust utility for performing AES encryption and decryption of data objects in Python. It also provides methods to test the correctness and throughput of the encryption and decryption processes.
