# FineTuner Module

This is a Python module for fine-tuning models for causal language tasks. It leverages the Commune and Transformers Python packages and is designed to be extended with additional functionality.

## Features

- Training and saving checkpoints: The 'train' method trains the model across a specified number of epochs and saves checkpoints.
- Text generation: Supports text generation based on input text.
- Model selection: Allows different models to be fine-tuned.
- Checkpoints loading: Supports loading of model weights from a saved checkpoint.

## Usage

You can initialize this module with specific configurations, train the model and generate text. Here is an example:

```python
from FineTuner import FineTuner

config = SomeConfig
finetuner = FineTuner(config)
generated_text = finetuner('This is a prompt text.')

```

## Key Classes and Methods

- `FineTuner`: The main class, provides support for training, loading and saving checkpoints, and generating texts.
- `set_model`: Sets up the pre-trained model and tokenizer.
- `train`: Runs the training process.
- `forward`, `generate`: These methods are used to generate texts.
- `load_checkpoint`, `save_checkpoint`: Load and save model weights respectively.
- `set_trainer`: Set up the trainer based on the configuration.
- `set_dataset`: Loads the dataset for the training process.

## Requirements

- Python
- Commune Python package
- Transformers Python package
- PyTorch
- Other Python packages: TRL, PEFT, BitsAndBytes, SciPy, Datasets

## Notice

This code assumes that you have access to the relevant resources and permissions to run the training jobs. It also needs specific model architecture to be specified in the configurations. Please ensure you have installed all the required Python packages.
