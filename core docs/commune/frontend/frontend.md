# Frontend Module

This is a Python module for managing a frontend application using docker-compose. This module leverages the Commune Python package. 

## Features

- Docker-compose integration: This module allows you to control your docker-compose applications with Python.
- Documentation integration: The `copy_docs` method copies documentation files from specific modules to the frontend's documentation directory, essentially providing a means of updating your frontend's documents using Python code.
- Logs access: The `logs` method allows access to logs through terminal commands.
- Dynamic file paths: The methods with '_path' suffix return dynamically determined file paths based on the current setup of the module.

## Usage

You can use this module to manage your frontend using Python and Commune. Here is an example:

```python
from Frontend import Frontend

frontend = Frontend()
frontend.run()
frontend.up(port=300)
log_data = frontend.logs()
docs = frontend.docs()
copy_docs = frontend.copy_docs()
```

## Key Classes and Methods

- `Frontend:` The main class, used to manage the frontend.
- `run:` An empty method that can be overridden in subclasses to carry out tasks when the frontend runs.
- `logs:` Fetches the logs from the frontend application.
- `up:` This runs the frontend application using the docker-compose tool.
- `{method}_path:` methods that return specific paths related to the module or documentation.

## Requirements

- Python
- Commune Python package
- Docker and Docker-compose installed on the system.

## Notice

The user must ensure docker-compose and the frontend application are installed and correctly setup on the system. Also ensure that the Python environment has necessary permissions for file/directory operations. Use this module with caution as it has the ability to manipulate and control docker-compose applications.
