# Commune Agent

The Commune Agent is built upon `commune.Module` and is designed with problem-solving using tools and memory in mind. The Agent interfaces with models found on the commune network and leverages specified tools to solve presented problems.

## Features

- **Serialize models into callable agents**
    - Use models as part of a commune network or set a predefined model to the agent.

- **Tool Management**
    - Attach or detach specific tools as needed. 

- **Memory**
    - Make use of historical data to solve problems. Requires the use of knowledge tuples. 

- **Confidence Scoring**
    - Score the confidence level of the solution provided from 0 to 1.

## Example Usage

```
agent = Agent(
    name='agent',
    description = None, 
    model : str = 'model.openai', 
    tools: list = tools
)

response = agent.test(prompt='What is the capital of France?', model=None, history=None)
```

In this example, we instantiate a Commune agent and have it answer the prompt "What is the capital of France?". The response generated by the agent will be a dict containing the original prompt and the response provided by the agent.

## Testing

Testing functions (`test_model`, `test`) are provided to ensure that the agent and the underlying models work as expected.

## Extensibility

New tools can be added or existing ones removed as needed, and the agent's underlying model can also be easily changed.
