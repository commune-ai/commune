# Equal Intervals Bin Function for Pandas Series

This function `equal_intervals_pandas_series` divides a given Pandas series into a specified number of equally-spaced intervals or bins. Each value in the series is then replaced by the lower bound of the bin it falls into.

## Function:

### `equal_intervals_pandas_series(series, nbins=10) -> pandas.Series`

This function takes a Pandas series and an optional argument `nbins` for the number of equally sized bins the series should be divided into. By default, `nbins` is set to 10. The function calculates the maximum and minimum values of the series and determines the size of each bin. It then loops over each bin, replacing each series value falling within a bin's limits with the lower bound of that bin. 

The function imports the `pandas` module and returns the modified series.

## Usage:

This function is useful in data analysis and preprocessing steps when you need to discretize continuous values or reduce the number of unique values in a series. The binning strategy used here is "equal width", meaning each bin spans an equal range of values. Other strategies, like "equal frequency" (each bin has roughly the same number of values) might be more appropriate depending on the properties of the data.
